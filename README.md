# ObjectDebugger

The **ObjectDebugger** is a run-time Object Inspector for Delphi VCL applications

> The **original project** was released by **Marco Cantù** at http://github.com/marcocantu/ObjectDebugger. Since its release in 2016, I decided to [make some contributions](https://github.com/marcocantu/ObjectDebugger/pulls/alefragnani), but most of them were not merged. So, I decided to evolve this fork.

## Usage

The component is very simple. Just drop it on you `MainForm` :smile:. When you open your application, its window will appear. It looks, and works, like **Delphi Object Inspector**, but at run-time. 

You just have to open the desired form, choose the component and change its properties. 

## Compatibility

It currently supports the following Delphi versions:

* Delphi Seattle
* Delphi Berlin
* Delphi Tokyo

> The _Edition_ is irrelevant

## Installation

* Clone the repo `https://github.com/alefragnani/ObjectDebugger.git`
* Open the `ObjectDebugger.dpk` package
* Compile and Install
